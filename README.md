# time-tracker
App to help with tracking where time is going during workday

Should be able to support multiple UI setups: Web App, Desktop App, StreamDeck all for being able to tag event markers.
It'll aim to generate reports and the UIs should give display countdowns for time expected to be logged during the day.
